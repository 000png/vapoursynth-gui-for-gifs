# TODOs for zero

* add G41Fun.py to archive
* add FFmpeg to archive
* Add PyQtWebEngine to archive
* resize/cropping don't have to copy & paste, need to figure out how to communicate between the two
* loading bars while subprocesses are running
* presets and save history
    * custom saved JSONs
    * load preset should be in top menu bar
* add labels to video panels so we know what's original vs rendered
* extract ScriptHandler from VSPanelLayout so its less of a god class
