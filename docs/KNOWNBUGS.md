# Known bugs and issues

* *.mov files don't seem to play in preview screen when resizing/cropping is applied and NO PREPROCESSING is applied
    * may need to make preprocessing a requirement if resizing/cropping applied? or set default to have preprocessing
    * i think its the resizing (descale) requires preprocessing
