# VapourSynth GUI for Gifs
by zero

A simple GUI for preprocessing videos with vapoursynth with the intention to make gifs. For any questions/comments please contact me through my tumblr at [000png.tumblr.com](https://000png.tumblr.com/).

This GUI is written in Python using the PyQt5 library. Currently I've only confirmed this to work on Windows 10.
